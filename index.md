Here is some great information (an interview) that I found online about Jay Mac Rust and Landon Northcutt and their business, On Campus Lab.

Enjoy!

Hello listeners, this is John Walker from Lab Tech News.  We are all really overjoyed today that you get to be a part of this discussion!  For those of you who’ve been paying attention in the last week, we have discussed disruptions in other sectors, and how this will be soon experienced in our own industry.  We’ve invited two men in on today’s broadcast, Mr. J. Mac Rust, and Mr. Landon Northcutt of Stephenville, Texas to become more knowledgable of how a little organization that these gentlemen helped create could become the game changer of a disruptive motion in the laboratory analysis sector. 

John: L. Northcutt, with On Campus Laboratory and Mac Rust, with On Campus Lab, I am so grateful you’ve allowed us an opportunity to interview today so that we all will be able to learn more about your company, On Campus Laboratory Services and the disruption that its’ model will potentially cause to the lab testing world.

J. Mac Rust: Mr. Walker, you are surely welcome!  The two of us are excited to be here today.

Landon Northcutt:  Definitely, Mr. Walker, we’re thankful you have extended an invitation to us to speak with you and your readers!

John:  Will you guys tell these readers a little about On Campus Laboratory?

J. Mac Rust: Definitely Mr. Walker.  On Campus Lab, put simply is a service that connects country hospitals and big city clinics.

John:  That sounds like it makes sense. Can you tell us what does this relationship consist of?

Landon Northcutt:  We’ve discovered that doctors in large city areas were dealing with a lot of churn and burn lab analysis for all of their lab testing and services.  Usually this could be finished quickly, but accurateness was a consideration, customer service was low, and it just wasn’t what it used to be.  Given that the two of us reside in a small community an hour’s drive from Fort Worth, TX, we observed that there are a considerable amount of hospitals in rural cities around our area with millions of dollars of lab resources being unused because they do not have a sizable enough local census count in their servicing area to to allow it to make sense in terms of dollars and cents.

J. Mac Rust: Mr. Walker, at the heart of it, we visualize our role of On Campus Laboratory as relationship makers between the doctor’s offices and these small town hospital labs.  Our company provides a service that includes the deliverer between the doctor’s offices and the lab analysis locations.  We establish relationships between these entities so that everyone wins: the hospital board sees an increase in money being made from the lab analysis services being used more often, the doctors are receiving quality services by non-overworked employees that are in a more relaxed workspace, and the patients are getting answers back that have a higher degree of reliability, and taking the same amount of time or less than it took before.

John: Jay you bring up an intriguing implication.  You stated that you are seeing a quality difference due to it being a small town laboratory services facility, instead of a large city laboratory testing facility.  Will you discuss on that?

Landon Northcutt:  Sure Mr. Walker, Mac brings up an intriguing implication.  What we have discovered is that in a fair share of the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan region lab analysis facilities, they really are a churn and burn environs to work in.  They’re trying to process a large number of lab results per day, and their workers are under pressure to make quotas.  That type of nature as in any area of our lives creates stress.  This stress will have an effect on the technicians, the services being delivered, and the workplace itself.  In turn, this has obviously shown to have an effect on the doctor’s offices whom order the lab results, the patients, and the community.  We’ve learned that the low anxiety environment of much of our rural communities’ medical care facilities makes upbeat staff.  These are employees that are well-educated and have the ability to use all of the same lab equipment that you will have access to in the city, but their work environs isn’t the similar high turnover approach.  With that in mind, they’re capable to take the amount of time to be methodical and observe procedures with fewer mistakes.

John:  Gentlemen, what is the mission statement of On Campus Labs?

J. Mac Rust: Connecting rural hospitals with forward thinking doctors.  That is what we exist for.  Mr. Walker, we surely believe that it takes a progressive thinking doctor or out of the box thinker (whatever you want to call it) to really get the genius in the model.  And, we also believe that as many more doctor’s offices are researching options, that their minds are going to be turned to this model simply out of the necessity of change.

Landon Northcutt: Let’s make ourselves understood about this John.  We are not saying that small community hospital lab analysis facilities will take over and lab services facilities in big city areas should see a dangerous drop in business.  We’re just stating that this model is a viable alternate that a greater number of medical professionals are going to move to as the industry move forward.  There is an enormous amount of room in this sandbox for everyone to be able to play together cordially and have their slice of the action.

John: Quickly, tell me some more about your OCL.  What variations of services does On Campus Laboratories provide?

J. Mac Rust: Our testing services include: Wellness Blood Testing, Blood Allergy Testing, Pharmacogenetics Testing, Respiratory Pathogen Panels, and Toxicology Panels.

John: You have the ability to provide most lab services out there?

Landon Northcutt:  Close, John.  There are a few smaller segments that our company hasn’t jumped in to yet, simply because the demand locally is so minuscule and the equipment for these labs is very pricey.  There’s no need to own lab equipment that is not going to make money for a very long time when we’re pretty sure doctor’s offices are not going to be sending in orders for lab results that must have the ownership of those machines.

John: Mac, Let’s get back to where we started, will you be using this to take over the world?

J. Mac Rust:  Landon, do you want to take this one?  Hahaha.  I’m really kidding.  No, Mr. Walker, as far as we can see, we’re simply settling on solving problems in this industry in the state of Texas.  Unquestionably, we can see how this model is going to make changes to the industry in each region, and there is no doubt that other businesses are going to figure out how to make it happen in their states and regions.  Texas is a giant piece of the pie.  We have got our schedules filled up with this right now and for as far as we can see ahead.

John:  Okay Gentlemen, thank you for taking a few minutes with me and answering me and the followers in these questions.

J. Mac Rust: You are welcome for sure Mr. Walker.  Many thanks for giving us this opportunity!

Landon Northcutt: Yes, Mr. Walker.  Thank you for having us.

John: We are looking forward to following along with your progress and discovering what will lie ahead for your company.  Once again, much gratitude for the time you spent with us.
